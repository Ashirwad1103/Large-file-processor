# Large-file-processor

Overview:
This project is designed to handle the efficient uploading, chunk-based processing, and merging of large files. It incorporates concurrent requests for uploading file chunks, task queuing for asynchronous processing, and a robust backend powered by Flask, Celery, and Redis.

Features
    1. Chunk-Based Uploads: Large files are split into manageable chunks for upload.
    2. Concurrent Processing: Concurrent API calls handle chunk uploads simultaneously.
    3. Asynchronous Processing: Task queue ensures non-blocking processing of chunks using Celery.
    4. Storage Management: Temporary chunk storage followed by merging into the final file.
    5. Fault Tolerance: Redis stores metadata to monitor upload and processing progress.
    6. High Scalability: Designed to scale across multiple workers.

Requirements
    Software - 
        1. Python 3.8+
        2. Redis
        3. MongoDb

    Python Libraries

Assumptions

    1. Disk Space: Sufficient disk space is available to store temporary file chunks and the merged file.
    2. Memory: Metadata (stored in Redis) fits within the systemâ€™s memory constraints.
    3. Network: Stable network connection for concurrent chunk uploads.
    4. Concurrency: System supports high concurrency levels without overwhelming resources.

        celery -A celery_app.tasks worker --pool threads --concurrency 4 --loglevel=info

    5. Run the Flask Application
        python app/main.py

    6. Run the Application with Waitress (for production)
        waitress-serve --host=127.0.0.1 --port=5000 app.main:app



Tests - 

Pytest Command - pytest -s 

1.  tests/test_auth.py - Auth tests 
    Running tests will print Auth token on console.

2. Use the create_chunks_script.py to test sending chunks
    Use the Auth_Token received from the above tests
    Replace AUTH_TOKEN present on line "11".

Design Considerations
    1. Chunk Size: Ensure the chunk size balances upload speed and server processing time.
    2. Concurrency Limits: Restrict concurrent uploads to prevent resource exhaustion.
    3. Error Handling: Retries are implemented for failed chunk uploads.
    4. Monitoring: Use Redis to track the status of each file upload.


Future Enhancements
    1. Cloud Storage: Store chunks and final files in S3 or equivalent.
    2. Streaming: Support real-time chunk streaming.
    3. Enhanced Fault Tolerance: Handle Redis or worker failures more gracefully.
